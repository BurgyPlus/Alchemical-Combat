# Overview
Alchemical Combat aims to improve combat with potions since using vanilla potions comes with many drawbacks. Alchemist's Potions are upgraded potions that use cooldowns to stop potion spamming while not removing the potion from the player's inventory. This solves the inventory space problem that vanilla potions have as the player only needs one of a specific Alchemist's Potion and can then use it multiple times.

# Potions
Alchemist's Potions come in three categories: Enhancement, Debuff, and Damaging. Enhancement potions contain effects that buff whatever they affect. Debuff potions do the opposite and cripple what they affect. Damaging potions are designed for pure offense and inflict Magic Damage which ignores Physical Armor. All potions have 1,561 uses; the same as a Diamond Sword's durability.
